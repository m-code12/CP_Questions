You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: "a"
Example 4:

Input: s = "ae", t = "aea"
Output: "a"
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lower-case English letters.

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        sort(s.begin(),s.end());
        sort(t.begin(),t.end());
        int i;
        for(i=0;i<t.size()-1;i++){
            if(s[i]!=t[i]){
                return t[i];
            }
        }
        return t[t.size()-1];
        
    }
};
