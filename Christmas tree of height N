Input: In the first line, you will be given ”t” no. of test cases. For each test case, you will be given a whole number “N”.

Output: For each value N, Print the first N lines in Christmas tree.

Constraints:   1≤T≤100

Explanation
For each line find the binomial coeffients and print the values with required spaces between them.

Solution:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
		int n;
		cin>>n;
		long long int arr[n][n];
		int i,j;
		arr[0][0]=1;
		for(i=1;i<n;i++){
			arr[i][0]=1;
			arr[i][i]=1;
			for(j=1;j<i;j++){
				arr[i][j] = arr[i-1][j-1]+arr[i-1][j];
			}
		}
		for(i=0;i<n;i++){
			for(j=0;j<=i;j++){
				cout<<arr[i][j]<<" ";
			}
			cout<<endl;
		}

	}
	
}
